# Medicine_clustering
This project is to analyze a raw dataset of medicines, clean and standardize the data, and group similar medicines into clusters. This approach aims to identify duplicates and group variants of the same medicine. The final deliverables include a cleaned dataset, clustering results, an optimized database schema, and an accuracy evaluation script.
